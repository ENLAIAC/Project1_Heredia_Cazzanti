# TCCM Homework 1: Computation of the MP2 Energy

## 📌 Project Description
This project implements a C program to compute the **Hartree-Fock (HF) energy** and **MP2 correlation energy** for a closed-shell system. It reads molecular integrals and orbital energies from **TREXIO** files (HDF5 format) and calculates the total energy.

The current implementation focuses on the Hartree-Fock self-consistent field (SCF) energy calculation, as described in the `mp2.pdf` assignment.

## 📂 Directory Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

**`HF/`**: Contains the source code for the Hartree-Fock calculation (e.g., `HF.c`).
**`MP2/`**: Contains the source code for the MP2 energy correction.
